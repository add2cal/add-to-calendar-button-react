# The Add to Calendar Button - optimized for React

This is a wrapper repository for the popular [Add to Calendar Button](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button), making it even more convenient, to create beautiful buttons in React, where people can add events to their calendars.

<br /><br />

This is for everybody, who wants to include a button in their React application, which enables users to easily add a specific event to their calendars.
The main goal of this repository is to keep this process as easy as possible at maximum compatibility. Simply define your button configuration and everything else is automatically generated by the script.
Supporting calendars at Apple, Google, Microsoft (365, Outlook, Teams), Yahoo, and generic iCal.

![Supported Calendars: Apple (via iCal), Google, Microsoft (365, Outlook, Teams), Yahoo, generic iCal](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button-react/blob/main/assets/badge-supported-calendars.svg)

In terms of system support, **all modern browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) on **Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS** as well as rather restricted webview environments like the **Instagram** in-app browser are supported.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the package using the following npm command:

```sh
npm install add-to-calendar-button-react
```

It requires React and React-Dom, both >=18.0.0. The installer will warn you automatically if your setup does not fit.

<br /><br />

## üéõÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

Import the component wherever you want to use it:

```javascript
import { AddToCalendarButton } from 'add-to-calendar-button-react';
```

Use the componet inside your code and declare any options as props. You will get warned about any type misconfiguration.

Calendar type options and time zone information are not required, but recommended.

```javascript
<AddToCalendarButton
  name="Test-Event"
  startDate="2023-05-22"
  options={['Apple','Google','Yahoo','iCal']}
  timeZone="America/Los_Angeles"
></AddToCalendarButton>
```

<br /><br />

If you need to use the type explicitely, you can import it via:

```javascript
import type { AddToCalendarButtonType } from 'add-to-calendar-button-react';
```

<br /><br />

When using the PRO version, you can keep it even shorter, as you would only need the proKey.

```javascript
<AddToCalendarButton proKey="prokey-of-your-event"></AddToCalendarButton>
```

<br />

### All options and hidden features

Find all information about the available props and how to configure specific features on the demo page at [add-to-calendar-button.com/configuration](https://add-to-calendar-button.com/configuration).

Mind the difference to the web component! At this wrapper, you would use the `<AddToCalendarButton>` component instead of the `<add-to-calendar-button>` custom element.

**Also mind that, different to the main package, with the React wrapper, you can actually declare arrays (like with the options prop) as arrays and objects (like with multi-date setups) as objects!**
