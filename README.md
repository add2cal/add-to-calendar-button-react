# The Add to Calendar Button - optimized for React

This is a wrapper repository for the popular [Add to Calendar Button](), making it even more convenient, to create beautiful buttons in React, where people can add events to their calendars.

<br /><br />

This is for everybody, who wants to include a button at his/her React application, which enables users to easily add a specific event to their calendars.
The main goal of this repository is to keep this process as easy as possible at maximum compatibility. Simply define your button configuration and everything else is automatically generated by the script.
Supporting calendars at Apple, Google, Microsoft (365, Outlook, Teams), Yahoo, and generic iCal.

![Supported Calendars: Apple (via iCal), Google, Microsoft (365, Outlook, Teams), Yahoo, generic iCal](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button/blob/main/assets/badge-supported-calendars.svg)

In terms of system support, **all modern browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) on **Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS** as well as rather restricted webview environments like the **Instagram** in-app browser are supported.

## üì¶ Installation

Import the package using the following npm command:

```
npm install add-to-calendar-button-react
```

<br /><br />

## üéõÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

Import the module into your project/component:

```
import { atcb_action, atcb_init } from 'add-to-calendar-button';
```

Either use `atcb_action` with your own buttons/forms/etc, or run `atcb_init` after the DOM has been loaded. To determine the right moment to execute the `atcb_init`, with React, you might want to include an event listener for `DOMContentLoaded` or use a hook in a functional component like `useEffect(() => atcb_init());`.

Include the css. Add `@import 'add-to-calendar-button/assets/css/atcb.css'` to some other css file - or include it in other more direct ways (like adding `import 'add-to-calendar-button/assets/css/atcb.css';` to the respective component) (use atcb-3d for an alternative style).

#### atcb_action

If you can't or don't want to use `atcb_init`, you can use the `atcb_action` import with your own buttons or other elements/components.

This may work better with React and other frontend frameworks, but it misses the Schema.org and button specific functionalities.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { atcb_action } from 'add-to-calendar-button';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState("Some event");
  const changeName = e => {
    setName(e.target.value);
  };
  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      atcb_action({
        name,
        startDate: "2022-10-14",
        endDate: "2022-10-18",
        options: ['Apple', 'Google', 'iCal', 'Microsoft365', 'Outlook.com', 'Yahoo'],
        timeZone: "Europe/Berlin",
        iCalFileName: "Reminder-Event",
      });
    }}>
      <input value={name} onChange={changeName} />
      <input type="submit" value="save" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

#### atcb_init

Alternatively, you could use `atcb_init` with a `useEffect` hook:

```js
import React from "react";
import { atcb_init } from "add-to-calendar-button";
import 'add-to-calendar-button/assets/css/atcb.css';

const MyComponent = () => {
  React.useEffect(atcb_init, []);
  return (
    <div className="atcb">
      { '{' }
        "name":"Add the title of your event",
        "description":"A nice description does not hurt",
        "startDate":"2022-02-21",
        "endDate":"2022-03-24",
        "startTime":"10:13",
        "endTime":"17:57",
        "location":"Somewhere over the rainbow",
        "label":"Add to Calendar",
        "options":[
          "Apple",
          "Google",
          "iCal",
          "Microsoft365",
          "Outlook.com",
          "Yahoo"
        ],
        "timeZone":"Europe/Berlin",
        "iCalFileName":"Reminder-Event"
      { '}' }
    </div>
  );
}
```
