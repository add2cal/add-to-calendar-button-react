# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**If you believe you have discovered a security issue within this repository's latest release, please reach out directly via email:
[security@add-to-calendar-pro.com](mailto:security@add-to-calendar-pro.com).**
A [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button-react/security/advisories) case will be opened for tracking the fix. 
In case the issue is affecting the parent ["add-to-calendar-button"](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button) repository, the case will be created there instead.

Any support is highly appreciated and will be credited within the respective fix note.
For properly handling the case, the following best practice behavior is inevitable:

- Do not publish any information about the vulnerability prior to the release of the respective fix, in order to give everybody the chance to update.
- Do not disclose the details of your findings even afterwards. We want to make the world safer, not burn it down.
